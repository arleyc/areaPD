Description: The package areaPD containts three functions for calculating
  phylogenetic diversity (PD) for a set of geographic areas, calculating
  complementarity PD given a selected area, and constructing a Venn's 
  diagram of PD within and between areas, given a phylogenetic tree and 
  an assignment of samples (e.g., alleles, species, etc.) to areas.
